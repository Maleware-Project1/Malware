# Malware WordleRansom
## Overview
WordleRansom is a ransomware application designed for Window Operation to encrypt all ".txt" files within the current folder where it is executed. It utilizes a key obtained from a remote server to encrypt the data within these files. However, unlike traditional ransomware that demands a monetary payment for decryption keys, WordleRansom requires the user to successfully solve a Wordle game in order to unlock the encrypted files.


## Getting Started
To get a trial of the virus, follow these steps:
  1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Malware.git`
  2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Malware`
  3. Run the virus: `Valorant.bat`


## Detailed Description:
  ### Setup Environment:
  **valorant.bat** first sets up the necessary environment:
    - It downloads Python 3.9.
    - Utilizes pip to install all required libraries.

  ### Execution of Ransomware:
  Upon execution, **valorant.bat** triggers **ransomware.py**, which carries out the following tasks:
    - Displays an alert to the user.
    - Sends the MAC address of the current machine to the server database.
    - Receives a symmetric key from the database.
    - Iterates through the current folder to identify all ".txt" files.
    - Encrypts each ".txt" file using the received symmetric key from the server.

  ### Decryption Process:
  After encryption, **valorant.bat** proceeds to execute **decrypt.py**, which performs the following actions:
    - Prompts the user to play a Wordle game from **wordle.py**
    - Upon correct solution of the Wordle, retrieves the symmetric key from the server. Else, user could choose to replay, or let the file being encrypted. 
    - Iterates through the current folder to locate all ".txt" files.
    - Decrypts each ".txt" file using the obtained symmetric key.


## Techstack/Libraries used:
  1. **fernet**: used for encrypted and decrypted (AES-128)
  2. **requests**: sent MAC address, as well as received key from a remote server to encrypt/decrypt.
  3. **wordle.py**: built a wordle game with Python


## Future Improvements:
  1. File Diversity:
  Enhance the ransomware to target a broader range of file types beyond simple ".txt" files. This could include documents, images, videos, etc., expanding the impact and effectiveness of the ransomware.
  
  2. Enhanced Data Collection:
  Extend the ransomware's capabilities to collect more than just the MAC address. Consider gathering additional sensitive information such as folder structures, contents inside specific files, or other important data from the user's system. This would increase the leverage of the ransomware and potentially enable more sophisticated attacks.
  
  3. Selective Folder Targeting:
  Implement functionality for the ransomware to selectively target and encrypt files within specific folders deemed critical or valuable by the user. This strategic approach enhances the ransomware's potency and increases the likelihood of compliance with the ransom demands.
  
  4. Multi-platform Compatibility:
  Develop versions of the ransomware compatible with multiple operating systems, expanding its reach to a broader range of users and systems.
